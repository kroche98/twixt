# JavaScript implementation of TwixT

[Twixt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TwixT) is a two-person strategy game which was released in the 1960s by 3M as part of its Bookshelf Games series. The goal is to build a barrier from one side of the board to the other.

To run and debug, you can use the [NPM package serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve), and then simply run `serve` from the folder containing the project.
